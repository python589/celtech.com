    <br>
    <p>our patience is ending we want palsitine free and we officialy dont recongnize israel </p>
    <br>
    <p>let us tell you the real story</p>
    <p>israel is also know as the most ungratefull of all abrahamic religions 
        thats why it is so arrogant the thing they hate about muslims is that they are jealous of there
        respect in world and that prophrt muhammad (pbuh) wasnt there prophet and there prophet will be 
        dajjal that in islamic religion s known as the biggest liar of all they claim palistine with the
        arguement that palistine was there 1300 years ago and god promised this land .with this logic america
        is belonged to the local of that land? i as a owner of celtech dont belevie that israel is even trust worthy
        if i would be president of a muslim ountry i would fight to free palistine thank you for reading this
